### 1. Introduction to Interrupt Handling

Interrupt handling is a fundamental aspect of low-level programming and operating system design. It involves managing interrupts generated by hardware devices or software events. This blog post will explore the details of interrupt handling, focusing on interrupt vectors and the handling process.

### 2. Understanding Interrupts

An interrupt is a signal sent to the CPU indicating that an event needs immediate attention. Interrupts allow the CPU to respond to asynchronous events, such as I/O operations or hardware failures, without polling for these events.

### 3. Types of Interrupts

#### 3.1 Hardware Interrupts

Hardware interrupts are generated by external devices, such as keyboards, mice, or disk controllers.

**Explanation:**

- **Interrupt Request (IRQ):** A signal sent by a hardware device to request CPU attention.
- **Interrupt Vector:** A data structure that maps interrupt numbers to handler routines.

#### 3.2 Software Interrupts

Software interrupts are generated by software instructions, such as system calls or exceptions.

**Explanation:**

- **Trap:** A software-generated interrupt, often used for system calls.
- **Exception:** An interrupt generated by the CPU in response to an error or exceptional condition.

### 4. Interrupt Handling Process

The interrupt handling process involves the following steps:

- **Interrupt Generation:** The device generates an interrupt signal.
- **Interrupt Acknowledgment:** The CPU acknowledges the interrupt.
- **Save Context:** The CPU saves the current state (registers, program counter).
- **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR):** The CPU executes the ISR for the interrupt.
- **Restore Context:** The CPU restores the previous state and resumes execution.

**Explanation:**

- **Interrupt Vector Table:** A table that maps interrupt numbers to ISR addresses.
- **Priority:** Interrupts can have different priorities, allowing the CPU to handle critical interrupts first.

### 5. Implementing Interrupt Handling in C

Here is a simple C program that simulates an interrupt handler:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void interrupt_handler(int sig) {
    printf("Interrupt signal %d received.\n", sig);
}

int main() {
    // Set the interrupt handler for SIGINT (Ctrl+C)
    signal(SIGINT, interrupt_handler);

    printf("Press Ctrl+C to generate an interrupt.\n");

    // Infinite loop
    while (1) {
        sleep(1);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **signal():** Sets the interrupt handler for a specific signal.
- **SIGINT:** Signal generated by Ctrl+C.
- **interrupt_handler():** Custom handler function.

### 6. Conclusion

Interrupt handling is a critical component of low-level programming and operating systems. By understanding the interrupt handling process, developers can create more responsive and efficient software.
